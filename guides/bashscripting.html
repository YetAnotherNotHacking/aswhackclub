    <h1>Bash Scripting | ASW Hack Club</h1>
    <h2>Intro:</h2>
    <p>Bash scripting is extremely useful for when you have something in the terminal that you need to do repeatedly and would take a while for you to do yourself or it is something that you do over and over again you can't repeat every time.</p>
    <p>Bash scripts run commands that are within them, if you want some more information about bash commands you can read <a href="basicsoftheterminal.html">intro to terminal.</a></p>
    <p>It takes a lot to write complex bash scripts as bash is such a huge set of things. We will supply a copy of Advanced Bash Scripting Guide by Mendel Cooper for its amazing quality and detail. If you need something more simple, we will work on something here and soon more simple alternatives to the Mendel's book will be suplied here</p>
