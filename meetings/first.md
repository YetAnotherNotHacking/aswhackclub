## Hacking?
Defenition of hacking (in Hack Club context)
 - it's not like in movies
 - we won't really be breaking into anything
 - it's about learning how to get computers to do things
 - it's about the certain kind of tinkering you need for programming
 - an adaptive mind that's able to notice how things work and get them to work how you want them to

## Signing up for slack
To participate in litteraly anything else with Hack Club than just our club, you need to be in the Slack.

## What meetings in the future will look like, and what you will need
Our meetings are usually going to be helping the members follow a workshop (https://workshops.hackclub.com/)

We might also be helping everyone through a YSWS (https://ysws.hackclub.com/)

It is very helpful if you have your own computer (laptop) at meetings, it really doesn't need to be very powerful.
